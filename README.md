### Welcome To My Profile!

### COVID Note
 Now that I am feeling better, I think it is time to get back into the full-swing of things. I do have to get myself used to this kind of workload again, but I believe I can do it with enough time and effort. Expect some big things soon!

I am Exploitables. I am a seventeen year-old exploit developer, with immeasurable amounts of motivation and drive. Helping others is what keeps me going.

### What I Am Currently Working On
- Creating my own technique for abusing ExFreePoolWithTag exploit primitives
- Creating an EXP-301 course equivalent (Open-Exploitation-1)
- Creating an EXP-401 course equivalent (Open-Exploitation-2)
- Discovering zero day vulnerabilities
- Learning bypasses for mitigations
- Studying QuÃ©bÃ©cois French
- Learning how to create Mercury (yes, the liquid metal)
- Most importantly... trying hard to not get burnt out

### Schedule
- 5/7/2022 -> 12/31/2022 (Throughout): Finish nt!ExFreePoolWithTag research (so I can submit a ZDI blog-post)
- 6/1/2022 -> 6/30/2022 (Throughout): Work on [Open Exploitation I](https://github.com/Exploitables/Open-Exploitation-1)
- Unset Schedule: Finish up nt!ExFreePoolWithTag research
- Unset Schedule: Get OSED certified

Bare in mind that this schedule is only a general mapping of what I plan to do. Other than exploit development things, I want to learn French, create Mercury, and create an AI. With that being said, I may want to take a break, and thus everything will be pushed back. I may finish things early on, and everything will be pushed forwards.
