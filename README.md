# Open Exploitation I and Open Exploitation II Course Notice
I am currently awaiting Offensive Security's go-ahead/approval to continue with Open Exploitation I. I will not update it until I have a confirmed notice.

# Welcome To My Profile!

I am Exploitables. I am a seventeen year-old exploit developer, with immeasurable amounts of motivation and drive. Helping others is what keeps me going.

### What I Am Currently Working On
- Creating my own technique for abusing ExFreePoolWithTag exploit primitives (post-poned to become a better exploit developer)
- Finding and exploiting vulnerable device drivers
- Studying Qu√©b√©coise French

If you are a cybersecurity enthusiast or a fellow exploit developer, consider following me!
