### Welcome To My Profile!

I am Exploitables. I am a seventeen year-old exploit developer, with immeasurable amounts of motivation and drive. Helping others is what keeps me going.

### What I Am Currently Working On
- Creating my own technique for abusing ExFreePoolWithTag exploit primitives
- Creating an EXP-301 course equivalent (Open-Exploitation-1)
- Creating an EXP-401 course equivalent (Open-Exploitation-2)
- Discovering zero day vulnerabilities
- Learning bypasses for mitigations
- Specially crafting [HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver) exploits
- Studying French
- Learning how to create Mercury (yes, the liquid metal)

### Exploit Development Schedule
- 5/6/2022 -> 5/7/2022: Develop HackSys exploits for Windows 10 (Stack Overflow /GS, Arbitrary Write)
- 5/7/2022: Create kernel ROP gadget instruction dumper (dump every offset to every instruction from every loaded kernel driver)
- 5/8/2022 -> 5/10/2022: Develop HackSys exploits for Windows 10 (Integer Overflow)
- 6/1/2022 -> 6/30/2022: Work on [Open Exploitation I](https://github.com/Exploitables/Open-Exploitation-1)
- Unset Schedule: Finish up nt!ExFreePoolWithTag research
- Unset Schedule: Get OSED certified

Bare in mind that this schedule is only a general mapping of what I plan to do. Other than exploit development things, I want to learn French, create Mercury, and create an AI. With that being said, I may want to take a break, and thus everything will be pushed back. I may finish things early on, and everything will be pushed forwards.
