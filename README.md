### Welcome To My Profile!

I am Exploitables. I am a seventeen year-old exploit developer, with immeasurable amounts of motivation and drive. Helping others is what keeps me going.

# Open Exploitation I and Open Exploitation II Course Notice
I am aware that I need to be working on these two courses, and I will do so. However, I will only begin working on these two courses (in their respective order) after successfully developing (or practically finishing) a kernel exploit. You should expect big things soon.

### What I Am Currently Working On
- Creating my own technique for abusing ExFreePoolWithTag exploit primitives
- Creating an EXP-301 course equivalent (Open-Exploitation-1)
- Creating an EXP-401 course equivalent (Open-Exploitation-2)
- Discovering zero day vulnerabilities
- Learning bypasses for mitigations
- Studying Qu√©b√©coise French
- Most importantly... trying hard to not get burnt out

### Schedule
- Unset Schedule: Work on [Open Exploitation I](https://github.com/Exploitables/Open-Exploitation-1)
- Unset Schedule: Finish up nt!ExFreePoolWithTag research
- Unset Schedule: Get OSED certified
- ... among numerous other things...
